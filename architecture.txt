Both Fileaway and Folders require an up-to-date file database with derived data. Some derivation tasks will likely need to be platform sepecific. Some derived data will inherenetly affect whether an item shows up in a given view. Does all data associated with an item need to update atomically? I hope not.

So there's an inherent pipeline.

- Discovery
- Derivation
	- Data available immediately (FS metadata)
	- Data available asynchronously

It would seem to make sense to use a database (SQLite) to back views. How does type safety for metadata work?
